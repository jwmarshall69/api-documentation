Code samples
This is our recommended convention for organizing code_samples:

x-codeSamples Path <lang>/<path>/<HTTP verb>.<extension> where:

<lang> - name of the language from this list.
<path> - path of the target method, where all / are replaced with _.
<HTTP verb> - verb of target method.
<extension> - ignored.
